# myMEETR
A web application that helps companies to organize meeting times, according to certain criteria such as importance level. Taking into account the date and time availability of each attending member for a meeting, the most suitable meeting times will be ranked in order of importance. Given our current circumstance with COVID-19, our application is aimed to help teams efficiently organize meetings time given restraints such as time zones.
